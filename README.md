# Face-Recognition-Algorithms

This project evaluates and compares critically a deep learning algorithm and a non-deep learning algorithm in the domain of face recognition. 

Used a Convolutional Neural Network, VGG-FACE for the deep learning method.

Used Viola-Jones face detection with Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) feature extraction for the non-deep learning approach.

Presented results and findings in a conference style research paper available in the pdf file.
